## Description 
Oasis is a Web app that offers or reserves space for an event.We believe that offering or reserving a space for an event should be easy and efficient, as well as seeking events to attend. The application provides a variety of spaces for different types of special events. On the other hand, the application also serves as a tool to help users to list their spaces online for event reservation.
